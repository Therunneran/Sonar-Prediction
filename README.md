Sonar Object Classification with Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates the use of logistic regression for classifying objects as either mines or rocks based on sonar returns. The dataset used is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Data Collection and Processing
The dataset used for this project is a sonar dataset where each instance is a pattern obtained by bouncing sonar signals off a metal cylinder or a rock.

Key steps in data processing:

Load the dataset using pandas.
Display basic statistical measures using describe().
Separate features and labels.
Model Training and Evaluation
The logistic regression model is trained using the LogisticRegression class from sklearn.linear_model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy scores on both the training and testing data.

Making Predictions
The script also includes a section for making predictions with the trained model. It reshapes the input data and uses the model to predict whether the object is a mine or a rock.

python
Copy code
input_data = (0.0307, 0.0523, 0.0653, 0.0521, 0.0611, 0.0577, 0.0665, 0.0664, 0.1460, 0.2792, ...)
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(input_data)
input_data_reshaped = input_data_as_numpy_array.reshape(1, -1)
prediction = model.predict(input_data_reshaped)
if (prediction[0] == 'R'):
    print('The object is a Rock')
else:
    print('The object is a Mine')
